# Hello World! 👋 I'm Ibrahim

## About Me

Senior Frontend Engineer with 6+ years building large-scale React and Next.js platforms used in production across global markets.

I specialise in frontend architecture, performance, and delivery at scale — from Nx monorepos and shared component systems to CI/CD pipelines and CMS-driven platforms.

I’ve owned and shipped frontend platforms supporting 20+ products and 3M+ users, with measurable impact including reduced deployment times, improved reliability, and significant performance gains.

I work best in product-focused teams where I can own the frontend end-to-end, collaborate closely with backend, design, and product, and focus on long-term maintainability, performance, and developer experience — not just shipping features.

Open to mid–senior roles where frontend quality, scale, and platform thinking matter.
